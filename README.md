# Python Homework 

## Data Analyticss and Visualization Bootcamp | University of Minnesota

### PyBank

* Instructions:

* For this homework assignment, we were tasked with creating a Python script to analyze financial records (PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* Required task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

### PyPoll

* In this challenge, we were given a set of poll data (PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Our task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast 

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes 

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won votes

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote 

* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
